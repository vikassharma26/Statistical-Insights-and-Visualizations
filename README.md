# Statistical-Insights-and-Visualizations

Welcome to the Statistical Data Analysis Showcase repository! This repository showcases my data analysis projects with a focus on statistical analysis using Python. These projects were part of an assignment given by a company to demonstrate my skills in statistical analysis and data visualization.

Questions Addressed:

1. Determine the outliers for wages and explain the steps, process, and logic.
2. Analyze the distribution of the 'Potential' column in the game data.
3. Explain the difference between normal and Student t-distribution using the 'Potential' column.
4. Understand the difference between normal and standard normal distributions using the 'Potential' column.
5. Calculate the 95%, 90%, and 99% confidence intervals for the 'Potential,' 'Wage,' and 'Weight' columns.
6. Prove the Central Limit Theorem using the 'Potential' column.
7. Provide additional insights gained from the data analysis and create visual presentations.
